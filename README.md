# Podscribe_Pricing


create an automated internal pricing tool
for this tool our team would input the "Monthly Attribution Impression," and it determines the appropriate tier and then calculates and displays the "Annual Rate," "monthly rate" along with the features either included for free at that tier or what features they would need to pay for along with  fees for adding those
To confirm, would we like the tool to do the following and create a user interface for such:
Automatically select the tier based on the provided "Monthly Attribution Impression Cap."
Display the "Annual Rate" and "monthly rate" for the selected tier - for both high and low rates (this is for negotiation)
Display the what the CPM is at that tier
List the features and fees included in that tier.
Optionally, provide any additional calculations or details for the selected tier, such as overage calculations or included features.
Highlevel steps
Accept the "Monthly Attribution Impression Cap" as input.
Determine the appropriate tier based on the provided impression cap.
Calculate and return the following: Annual Rate and monthly rate for the selected tier (both high and low rates)
CPM (Cost Per Mille) for the selected tier using both the minimum and maximum monthly rates.
The features and fees included in that tier and or the features they would need to pay for if not included
for features not included also calculate and display what the annual and monthly cost would be with those various features added
Notes: this can be a very basic user interface, but should be hosted so anyone on the team can access and interact.
